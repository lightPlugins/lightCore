# This system is used for synchronising data between multiple servers.
# You NEED to have a Redis Server running to use this system on multiple servers !!!
# INFO: If you are using a Pterodactyl Redis Server, you can use the docker
#       internal network to connect to the redis server:
#        - Default Docker Network Host: 172.18.0.1
#        - Default Port: 6379
server-synchronisation:
  # If enabled, the server synchronisation system will be enabled.
  # If you have only one server, you can leave this disabled.
  enable: false
  # How should we synchronise the data between the servers?
  # - mysql -> Use the mysql Database for server synchronisation
  # - redis -> Use a Redis Server (pub/sub channels) for server synchronisation (RECOMMENDED)
  type: mysql
  redis:
    # Only enable this if you have a redis server running,
    # and you want to use the server synchronisation system without the mysql database synchronisation.
